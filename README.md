# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

This project uses unsupervised learning (K-Means) to segment customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**. It helps businesses better understand customer behavior and develop targeted marketing strategies.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Segment customers into distinct groups
- Identify high-value and low-value customer segments
- Support data-driven business decisions

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:

- `CustomerID`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1–100)`

📦 Sample dataset: Mall Customer Segmentation (from Kaggle)

## 🧠 Methods Used

- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Elbow Method to find optimal number of clusters
- K-Means Clustering
- Data Visualization (scatter plots with cluster labels)
- Predictive function to assign new customers to a segment

---

## 📈 Output

- Labeled customer segments (e.g., "High Income, Low Spending")
- Visualization of clusters
- Function to predict segment for new customers
